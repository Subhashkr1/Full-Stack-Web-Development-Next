<p>Define a variable

A variable stores a value of any type, e.g., a string, a number, an array, or an object.

A variable has a name and is associated with a value. To define a variable, you use the following syntax:

$variable_name = value;
Code language: PHP (php)
When defining a variable, you need to follow these rules:

The variable name must start with the dollar sign ($).
The first character after the dollar sign ( $) must be a letter (a-z) or the underscore ( _ ).
The remaining characters can be underscores, letters, or numbers.
PHP variables are case-sensitive. It means that $message and $Message variables are entirely different.
