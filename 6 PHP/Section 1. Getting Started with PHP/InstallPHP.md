Installing PHP on your computer allows you to safely develop and test a web application without affecting the live system.

To work with PHP locally, you need to have the following software:

PHP
A web server that supports PHP. We’ll use the Apache webserver.
A database server. We’ll use the MySQL database server.
Typically, you won’t install all this software separately because connecting them is tricky and not intended for beginners.

Therefore, it’s easier to find an all-in-one software package that includes PHP, a web server, and a database server. One of the most popular PHP development environments is XAMPP.

XAMPP is an easy install Apache distribution that contains PHP, MariaDB, and Apache webserver. XAMPP supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
