        Types of tags
        <p>
            There are two types of tags in HTML:
            <p>
                1. Paired tags
                2. Unpaired tags
            </p>

            <p>
                1. Paired tags
                <p>
                    Paired tags are tags that have an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag is the same as the opening tag, except that it has a forward slash (/) in front of it.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    2. Unpaired tags
                    <p>
                        Unpaired tags are tags that do not have a closing tag. They are also called self-closing tags. They are used to insert media such as images, videos, and audio into a web page.
